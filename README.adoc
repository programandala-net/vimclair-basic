== Description

Vimclair BASIC is two things:

1. An improved version of Sinclair BASIC.

2. A program that converts a Vimclair BASIC source file to a TAP
file with its Sinclair BASIC equivalent.

Actually, Vimclair BASIC is just a Sinclair BASIC preprocessor
written in the Vim language â€” but it looks a different language.

== Features

- C-style block and line comments.
- Bash-style line comments.
- Labels instead of line numbers.
- `#vim` directive to execute any Vim command in the source.
- Long variable names for strings, arrays and `FOR` loops (using
  the `#vim` directive).
- Control structures (can be nested):
  - DO ... LOOP
  - DO ... LOOP UNTIL
  - DO ... LOOP WHILE
  - DO UNTIL... LOOP
  - DO UNTIL ... LOOP UNTIL
  - DO UNTIL ... LOOP WHILE
  - DO WHILE ... LOOP
  - DO WHILE ... LOOP UNTIL
  - DO WHILE ... LOOP WHILE
  - EXIT DO
  - EXIT FOR
  - IF ... THEN ... ENDIF
  - IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF
  - IF ... THEN ... ELSE IF ... ELSE ... ENDIF (with any number
    of ELSE IF)
- Procedures (without parameters):
  - DEF PROC, END PROC, EXIT PROC, CALL.  (Procedures with
    parameters can be simulated ad hoc with the #vim directive.)
- The CALL command can be changed with '#procedureCall', e.g.:
  #procedureCall proc Or even make it empty: #procedureCall
