BASIC], by Marcos Cruz (programandala.net).

== Fix

- Chained jumps created by the control structures.
- Check duplicated labels.
- Check all identifiers are matched at the start of the
  line or after a colon; this will prevent some mismatchs in
  text strings.
- Label definitions with uppercase letters are not
  recognized and removed.
- If a expression starts with a `NOT`, it should be removed
  instead of adding another `NOT` to it (when loops and
  conditional are converted to jumps).
- When '#filename X' is not at the left margin, the datum stored
  is part of "#filename".

== Improve

- Make `silent` configurable in #vim substitutions.
- Error message if `#include` file is not found.
- Now substitions can change ordinary texts. A fixed format is
  required, e.g. `variable&` or `constant!`...  Why not to use a
  common format for all variables, and let Vimclair BASIC to do
  the name translations automatically? The convertor would use
  the first empty name, from a to z.
- Parens used by `NOT` to enclose the `WHILE`.
- `UNTIL` or `IF` expressions could be ommited in certain cases.
- `gosub X:endproc` --> `goto X` and `gosub X:return` --> `goto
  X`.
- Errors should be returned as exit status, in order to make
  things easier for 'make' and other tools. But how?

== Implement

- Hex numbers.
- Configuration file?
- `#quiet` directive.
- Make tracing optional (`#tracing` directive?).
- Directive for size optimization. Then `VAL` will be added to line
  numbers and others (or substituted with `INT PI`, `SGN PI`...).
- Export the labels as Vimclair BASIC `#vim` directives, in order to
  reuse them in related programs.
- Write an installer.
