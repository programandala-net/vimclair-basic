- Started with the code of BBim2BB
  (http://programandala.net/es.programa.bbim).
- New: 'do...loop', 'do...loop until' and 'do...loop while'
  implemented.

== 2014-07-27

- New: First draft of 'do until...loop', 'do while...loop' and nested
  loops.

== 2014-07-31

- Fix: Some local variables have been changed to script variables.

== 2014-08-01

- Fix: All nine combinations of 'do...loop' work fine.
- New: Nested loops finished.
- New: 'exit do' implemented.
- New: 'exit for' implemented.
- New: 'else...endif' implemented.
- New: The TAP file is created (with the BAS2TAP converter).
- New: Procedures (without parameters): 'defproc', 'endproc', 'exit
  proc', 'proc'.

== 2014-08-02

- New: Syntax description of labels. 

== 2014-08-03

- New: First changes to implement procedure parameters.
- Improvement: The directory of the source file is the working
  directory.  This lets '#include' paths relative to it. XXX not
  tested yet.

== 2014-08-04

- Improvement: Long 'if...else...endif' structures; the previous
  'else...endif' method is removed.
- New: '#procedurecall' lets to configure the command used to call the
  a procedure (the default is 'call'), or make it empty.
- Change: Version A-01: first usable version, with loops and long
  conditional structures.
- New: Version A-02: long conditionals can be nested.
- Fix: '#procedureCall' was not parsed.
- Fix: Now 's:procedureCall' works also when empty.

== 2014-08-05

- New: Version A-03: the program saves copies of the file after every
  conversion step, for debugging.
- Change: The project and all its files are renamed and reorganized.
- Fix: Some procedures were not converted, because the search position
  was not restored in the loop.
- Fix: Removed a feature of BBim: Remove line numbers from import-time
  commands.
- Fix: --body-numbering=a was needed by the  nl tool. Otherwise empty
  lines that holded a lonely label were not numbered, and the label
  values didn't match anymore.
